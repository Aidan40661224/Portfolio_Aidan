# Workflow

This week I attended our lecture where we covered life cycles and development models relating to Software Engineering, and different types of team work flows and how all of these things can be combined to efficiently make good quality products that satisfy clients/users.

This was then followed by a practical session in a computer lab where we, in our teams, decided on a workflow we would follow while working on github issues, before allocating issues to each person to complete. I also familiarised myself with .Net Maui by following the tutorials on how to create a test app that allows you to create notes and a to-do list which uses an SQLite database.

The issue I was allocated was to create a table on a database for storing various equipment types.

## Task workflow

As a team we elected to follow the Github Flow workflow. This will allow us all to work individually on the shared project by creating our own branches to make changes without editing the main file incase we introduce any errors or bugs.

After being given administrative priviliges on the project board, I assigned myself the task on github, updated the task as 'in progress' and commented on it advising I would be completing it. I then moved all other assigned tasks that were still in the 'To Do' list, to 'In Progress'.

I then created a branch on in Visual Studio allowing me to implement changes without affecting the main repo. I have been able to pull updates to the main repo onto my branch as well as push my branch onto github so I can access it remotely rather than just locally.

I have also implemented Github Desktop to make following Github Flow easier.

Unfortunately due to an error with our app when we try to build it (as detailed in this week's reflection) I have not been able to complete my issue and implement the table for equipment types. I will however continue working on it and implement it in successfully as soon as possible.

## Reflection

Having come from a games development background, completing my HND at college, I have had limited experience at using databases. This has proved challenging for me as I am learning something new.

I feel the DoD is adequate as it is comprehensive enough that any sub standard work cannot be considered done, however it does have some flexibility in that acceptance criteria can be reviewed and negotiated if required. 

I feel the task board is intuitive enough and allows you to create, update and complete tasks easily enough and should allow us as a team to visualise the progress we are making. 

I would however say that we as a team have struggled to complete our issues so far. We have been unable to run our app as we receive an error stating 'System.DllNotFoundException' while attempting to launch it. It was also unclear to us whether we should be implementing these issues to the main repo via branches, or if we should be doing this individually as per our tutorial app. Some clearer instructions may have helped clarify this.
