# Workflow

This week I attended our lecture where we covered life cycles and development models relating to Software Engineering, and different types of team work flows and how all of these things can be combined to efficiently make good quality products that satisfy clients/users.

This was then followed by a practical session in a computer lab where we, in our teams, decided on a workflow we would follow while working on github issues, before allocating issues to each person to complete. I also familiarised myself with .Net Maui by following the tutorials on how to create a test app that allows you to create notes and a to-do list which uses an SQLite database.

The issue I was allocated was: INSERT ISSUE DESCRIPTION HERE

## Task workflow

Here, you should use screenshots and descriptive commentary to show that the required
have been completed successfully.

**DO**

* Consider the layout of your content from the point of view of the reader. Many raw
  screenshots will take up a lot of space. It may be better to adopt a different strategy
  such as
  * Using thumbnails with links to full-size images
  * Combining two or more screenshots into a single image 
  * Using partial screenshots to highlight only the important information
  * etc.
* Provide links to the actual objects (e.g. task, pull request, etc.) in the team project
  in GitHub
* Read through your work to make sure that the information comes across clearly

**DON'T**

* Use humour or informal language
* Waste space with trivial or self-evident commentary
* Abbreviate your commentary using (e.g. by using bullet points). Your text should be in
  the form of grammatically correct sentences.

## Reflection

Having come from a games development background, completing my HND at college, I have had limited experience at using databases. This proved a slight challenge as I am not as confident with implementing these as others may be. However I followed the tutorial closely and paid attention to the explanations given, and further researched or reached out to my team mates with any questions I had or any errors I encountered. 

I feel the DoD is adequate as it is comprehensive enough that any sub standard work cannot be considered done, however it does have some flexibility in that acceptance criteria can be reviewed and negotiated if required. 

I feel the task board is intuitive enough and allows you to create, update and complete tasks easily enough. 

You should also briefly discuss the current process and how it could be refined or improved in future iterations. For example, is the DoD adequate or too onerous? Is the current procedure for updating the task appropriate? Is the task board configured to work in an intuitive way?
