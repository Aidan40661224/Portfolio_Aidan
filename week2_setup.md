# Setup

Today was the first day of our Software Engineering module.

Following a lecture on what the module will contain, we had our practical lesson where we were assigned into teams. 

We were tasked with ensuring our development environments were setup correctly, creating and accessing a shared Github repo for our team, and making sure we can clone and commit repos.

## Environment configuration

I managed to configure my environment and have taken some screenshots to evidence this:

  <figcaption align = "center"><b>Fig.1 - This image shows I have successfully created and commited a repo</b></figcaption>
</figure>

Here you can see I have created and committed a test project, I have a template of our portfolio as well as my personal portfolio, and I also have access to our team repo.

## Reflection

I believe this configuration is suitable for our group work as it provides excellent version control capabilities, and allows us to view, review and edit our work as we go.
This will be crucial while working in a large team as there will be lots of moving parts working simultaneously.
However one limitation that became apparent fairly early on was that a lot of people in our team haven't used Github before, or weren't very confident using it.
This will provide some challenges in the early stages of our group work as it will take some people a little bit of time to get up to speed with Github, however luckily we have a few members who have experience using it and can assist those who need it.
